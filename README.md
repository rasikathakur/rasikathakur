## üéµ Beyond Code

When I'm not debugging or building something cool, you'll find me with my guitar üé∏, exploring new melodies, or getting lost in music. There's something magical about how both code and music follow patterns - maybe that's why I love them both!

Always excited to collaborate on innovative projects, discuss tech trends, or just chat about music! Whether you're looking for:
